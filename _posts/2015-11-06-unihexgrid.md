##What is it?

See for yourself: [A* demo]({{ site.baseurl }}public/projects/hex/demos/AS/gridAS.html)

It's a hexagonal grid spiral/ring indexation that stores every hexagon's index just like that: *[0, 1, 2, 3, ..., N]*.

##Why?

Someone challenged me... I think.

It was part of a bigger project and possibly will be used as the map grid in a game.

##Is it any good?

Yes. But it <del>probably</del> may not be your best choice, it really depends on what you want. You should check the [ultimate hexagonal grids reference](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) first.
